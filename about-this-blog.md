# About this blog

I use `Pelican` to generate this static html and Pelican theme `tuxlite_tbs` is used.

`highlight.js` for highlighting

Use `Github Pages` and `Coding Pages` to host my blog.
Use `Travis ci` to automatically generate the static files
Use `Issues` as a comment system

TODO:
>push blog to coding pages
