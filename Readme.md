### One More Things :-)
I am a Chinese but I may wirte my blog in English not just to practice my English but English is the global universal language. So I apologize in advance for my poor English and any advices will be very helpful. Thank you.

However, to make my blog more accessible to mainland, I will also host my blog in [Coding Pages](https://alex-itboy.coding.me/)
